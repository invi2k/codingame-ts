TypeScript code and library for codingame

Heavily based on the the example at [marzelin/codingame](https://github.com/marzelin/codingame). Without this example I could not have quickly gotten up and running, so thanks!

Requires having npm and node installed, run these commands to pull dependencies, create the JavaScript to run in codingame and execute the tests.
```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run test
```

After the build, the JavaScript file will be in the `out` directory and can be synced to the [codingame](https://www.codingame.com) IDE.
