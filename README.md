# codingame-typescript
TypeScript code and library for codingame

Heavily based on the example at [jbnimble/codingame](https://github.com/jbnimble/codingame-typescript). 

Requires having npm and node installed, run these commands to pull dependencies, create the JavaScript to run in codingame and execute the tests.
```bash
# get dependencies from npm
npm install
# build code in development mode
npm run dev
# build code in production mode - creates javascript
npm run build
# run unit tests
npm run test
```

After the build, the JavaScript file will be in the `out` directory and can be synced to the [codingame](https://www.codingame.com) IDE.
